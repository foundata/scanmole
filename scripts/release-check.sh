#
# Local, provider-independent release check for scanmole.
#
# Runs the full quality gate (format, lint, strict type check, tests) on every
# supported Python version, then builds the wheel and source distribution,
# installs the wheel into a clean throwaway environment and runs import and
# command-line smoke tests against the installed artifact, including the
# scanmole-gui launcher's defined behavior without PyGObject.
#
# This is intended to be run before tagging a release. It does not depend on
# any CI service; CI (if added) should call the same steps.
#
# Note: integration tests skip themselves without img2pdf and without the SANE
# "test" backend. For full coverage run
# this on a machine with both available; the per-device smoke checklist is a
# separate, manual step.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release-check.sh [PYTHON_VERSION ...]
#
# Without arguments the supported version matrix below is used.
